# Decentralized Crowdfunding for Courses

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Crowdfunding for Courses** platform is designed to enable course creators to raise funds through a decentralized method. Contributors can pledge funds to support the development of a specific course. If the funding goal is achieved within a predefined period, the course creator can access the funds to develop and distribute the course. If the goal is not reached, all contributors will receive refunds.

The smart contract ensures transparency, trust, and automation, as it operates on the Ethereum blockchain, where no central authority is needed.
